DO NOT EVER make a shell script unless told to. DO NOT EVER make a readme or a file describing your changes unless you are told to. If you have commands I should be entering into the command line or if you have something to explain to me, please just use code blocks or normal text output. DO NOT DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT YOU WERE TOLD TO DO. DO NOT EVER, EVER DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT YOU WERE TOLD TO DO.
IF YOU WANT TO DO OTHER THINGS, SIMPLY SUGGEST THEM, AND THEN | WILL REVIEW YOUR CHANGES, AND MAKE THE DECISION HOW TO PROCEED.
